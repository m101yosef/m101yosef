# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Product Data Scientist** with a background in Computer Science and flair for Visual Arts (yes, I love drawing and that's why I love data visualization the most).

The main value of my work is to provide data-driven insights that reduce uncertainty and help product teams make better product decisions (which leads to building products me and users love).

# What do I do?

1. **Identify user needs** by analysing usage data, feedback surveys, NPS scores etc.

2. **Validating assumptions and test hypotheses** through A/B testing, user research etc.

3. **Performing exploratory data analysis** to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from product data.

4. **Building machine learning models** (in some cases) to power personalization, prediction, ranking etc.

The end result is leveraging data to build products users love and businesses value. That's the magic a data scientist brings!
