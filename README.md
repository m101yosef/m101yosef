My name is Mohamed Yosef, an MLOps Engineer and AI Researcher from Egypt. I began as a user experience (UX) designer (2021-2023), crafting intuitive and enjoyable digital experiences. This background in design and creative thinking plays a crucial role in my current work, particularly in operationalising AI systems and applying advanced techniques like **deep reinforcement learning** (deep RL), where systems learn to make decisions by exploring different actions and learning from outcomes. I also focus on **human-AI interaction**, studying how AI and humans can collaborate to enhance each other's capabilities.

At Mansoura University, I lead the **AQSA project** (Sep 2023 - May 2024), which applies cutting-edge AI techniques to help small businesses thrive by bridging the gap between research and practical, real-world applications. AQSA comprises three core components: a Generative Chatbot (tailored to provide information about the startup ecosystem), Automated Data Analysis (for visualising insights from any dataset), and a Forecasting Module (which uses historical data, market trends, and factors like currency exchange rates to make accurate sales or interest predictions).

Currently, I work as an **MLOps Engineer**, where I help businesses streamline the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of machine learning models in production. MLOps is essential for bridging the gap between data science and business impact, ensuring that models not only work in development but also deliver consistent results in real-world environments. Businesses across various sectors — from e-commerce and finance to healthcare and logistics — benefit from MLOps by improving decision-making processes, automating tasks, and gaining real-time insights through reliable AI systems. By integrating machine learning into their workflows, companies can reduce costs, improve efficiency, and stay competitive in a fast-evolving landscape.
