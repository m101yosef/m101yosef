My name is Mohamed Yosef, a data scientist and researcher from Egypt. I started as a user experience (UX) designer (2021-2023), making apps and websites easy and enjoyable to use. 
My passion for design and creative thinking helps me a lot in my current work in data science, specifically  **deep reinforcement learning** (deep RL), a type of machine learning that helps machines make decisions by trying different actions and learning from the results. I also study **multi-agent learning**, which is about teaching multiple AI agents to work together and learn and solve problems. 

At Mansoura University, I lead a project called **AQSA** (2023-now) with a goal to help small businesses by using time-series and RL techniques to analyze and forecaste their data. So, you can say that AQSA is all about giving startups the tools to succeed!

While I don't design for businesses anymore, my love for art and creativity remains a strong personal passion. I still design the figures for my research papers and articles. The reason behind that is it feels special -- having complete control over the visual representation of my story -- which allows me to craft a clearer, more impactful work.

At the end, my main aim is to better understand the world around me and more importantly the brain inside my head. With the help of my design skills and data science techniques that I've learned over the last couple of years, I want to explain what I have discovered or known so that we can all RISE.
