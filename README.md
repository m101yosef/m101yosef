For me, science is not just knowledge; it's a way of thinking. It's a journey that began in the heart of Egypt, a place where the whispers of ancient mysteries still echo through the sands of time. My name is Mohamed Yosef, and I stand at the intersection of two great passions: mathematics and art.
