My name is Mohamed Yosef, a data scientist and researcher from Egypt. I started out in user experience design, which means I worked on making apps and websites easy and enjoyable to use. After that, I got into data science, where I now focus on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

Deep RL is a type of machine learning that helps machines make decisions by trying different actions and learning from the results. I also study multi-agent learning, which is about teaching multiple AI agents to work together and solve problems. At Mansoura University, I lead a project called AQSA where we help small businesses by using time-series and RL techniques to analyze and forecaste their sales data.

My main aim is to make AI agents helpful partners for people in their work and daily life. I believe that by combining my design skills with my knowledge of data, I can make AI agents that are not only smart but also easy and pleasant to use.
