For me, science is not just knowledge; it's a way of thinking. It's a journey that began in the heart of Egypt, a place where the whispers of ancient mysteries still echo through the sands of time. My name is Mohamed Yosef, and I stand at the intersection of two great passions: mathematics and art.

As my journey continued, I delved into the world of data science, where numbers and design converged in a symphony of insights. I realized that data was more than just raw information; it was the heartbeat of innovation. With the power of Python and the canvas of Figma, I painted stories from data, stories that could change the world for the better.
