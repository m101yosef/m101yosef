### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (Product) **Data Scientist** from Egypt with a background in Computer Science and flair for Visual Arts (yes, I love drawing and that's why I love data visualization the most).

The main value of my work is to provide data-driven insights that reduce uncertainty and help product teams make better product decisions (which leads to building products me and users love).
