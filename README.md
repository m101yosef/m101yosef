I bridge the gap between business goals and technical execution.

In the fast-moving E-commerce sector, success relies on clear communication, not just code. My role is to ensure that technical initiatives align perfectly with business objectives.

Currently, I am the Technical Program Manager at Khalas-ha Sah, where I oversee technical operations and digital services for e-commerce businesses.

I leverage a deep understanding of technical systems to set realistic timelines and remove operational bottlenecks, ensuring that the technology serves the business rather than complicating it.
