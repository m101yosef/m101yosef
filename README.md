Hi, I am Mohamed Yosef, a **Data Scientist, MLOps Engineer, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) Researcher** from Egypt. My journey began as a **UX designer (2021-2023)**, where I crafted intuitive digital experiences and learned how to design solutions that solve real-world problems. This background in design and creative thinking plays a crucial role in my current work, particularly in operationalizing AI systems and applying advanced techniques like **deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL)**â€”a field where systems learn to make decisions by exploring actions and learning from outcomes.

Currently, as an **MLOps Engineer**, I help businesses streamline the **deployment, monitoring, and scaling** of machine learning models in production environments. MLOps is essential for ensuring that models built in the development stage are **reliable, scalable, and deliver consistent results** in real-world applications. By focusing on **CI/CD pipelines**, **infrastructure management**, and **automation**, I ensure that AI systems perform effectively and adapt to evolving business needs.
