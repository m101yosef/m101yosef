### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Product Data Scientist** with a background in Computer Science and flair for Design. The main value of my work is to reduce uncertainty and help product teams make better product decisions.

The end result is leveraging data to build products users love and businesses value. That's the magic a product data scientist brings!
