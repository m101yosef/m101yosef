I'm a data scientist who's still early in the journey, but deeply interested in using data and machine learning in healthcare and neuroscience where my work will not go in-vain. 

I didn't start my career in data despite studying it at university. However, I began in user experience design, learning how people interact with technology. That time changed how I think now; always start from the human side of the problem, not just the technical one.

Eventually, I found myself drawn to data and mathematics, and I slowly shifted paths. Outside doing paid data projects for companies and startups, I write research reviews and reflections to help myself learn and share what I've learned with others.
